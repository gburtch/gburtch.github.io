I am the Kelli Questrom Associate Professor in Information Systems, Associate Professor of Information Systems, and Fellow of the Digital Business Institute at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. My research, which focuses on the economic evaluation of information systems, employs empirical analyses rooted in econometrics and field experimentation to identify and quantify the drivers of individual participation in online social contexts. My work has been published in various leading journals, including Management Science, Information Systems Research, MIS Quarterly, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, Organization Science, Production and Operations Management, the Journal of Law, Economics & Organization, and the Journal of Consumer Psychology.

I am a recipient of both the AIS Early Career Award (2017) and the INFORMS ISS Sandra A. Slaughter Early Career Award (2017). I am a recipient of the INFORMS ISR and ISS best paper award (2014). My research has been supported by more than $2 million in grants from various corporate, non-profit and government organizations, including the NSF, Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, the 3M Foundation, Adobe, Facebook Research and the European Commission. My work and opinions have been cited by numerous outlets in the popular press, including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, NPR, Time Magazine, Forbes, Vice, Wired, the LA Times, Pacific Standard and PC Magazine. I am a recipient of both the Best Reviewer and Best Associate Editor Awards from Information Systems Research. I presently serve as an Associate Editor for three INFORMS journals, namely Management Science, ISR and Service Science. I have previously served as track chair and associate editor for the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), twice as co-chair of the symposium on Statistical Challenges in eCommerce Research (SCECR), and twice as co-chair of the Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE). 

Prior to entering academia, I was employed as an information systems auditor, a hardware design engineer, and most recently as a technology consultant with Accenture Canada in Toronto. I teach graduate courses on data analytics and IT management. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering and a Master of Business Administration from McMaster University, as well as a PhD in Business Administration from Temple University's Fox School of Business.
